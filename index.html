                <p>A computer is not just a machine you use to browse the internet, play games, or do homework. 
                    It's actually a complex system made up of many smaller systems working together, which makes it a perfect example for a systems project.</p>
                <p> A computer as a system, helps you process information, store data, run programs, and display results.</p>

            <h2>Laptops</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>A laptop is like a portable computer that you can take with you wherever you go. Inside the laptop, there are different parts that work together to make it run. Here's what each part does:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> This is like the brain of the laptop. It holds all the parts together and lets them talk to each other.</li>
                    <li><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit):</strong> Think of the CPU as the computer's brain. It tells the laptop what to do when you click on things, type, or run programs.</li>
                    <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong> This is like the short-term memory. It helps the laptop remember things it’s working on right now, like an open game or web page.</li>
                    <li><strong>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):</strong> The GPU helps make images, videos, and games look smooth on the screen. It works hard when you’re watching a movie or playing a game.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hard Drive (HDD) or SSD (Solid State Drive):</strong> These are the places where your laptop stores things like files, games, and apps. An SSD is faster than an HDD, so it helps the laptop work quicker.</li>
                    <li><strong>Battery:</strong> The battery is what keeps the laptop running when you're not plugged into the wall. It gives power to everything inside.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cooling Fan:</strong> When the laptop gets too hot from working hard, the fan helps cool it down so it doesn't overheat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keyboard and Touchpad:</strong> The keyboard is where you type your commands, and the touchpad is like a built-in mouse that lets you move the cursor and click.</li>
                    <li><strong>Display Screen:</strong> This is the screen you look at to see everything. It shows pictures, words, videos, and anything else you're working on.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>PCs</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>A PC is like a bigger, more powerful version of a laptop. It usually sits on a desk and is made up of several parts that work together. Here’s what each part does:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> Just like a laptop, the motherboard connects all the parts in the PC and makes sure they can talk to each other.</li>
                    <li><strong>CPU:</strong> The CPU is the brain of the PC, telling everything what to do, just like in a laptop.</li>
                    <li><strong>RAM:</strong> RAM helps the PC remember things it’s working on right now, like an open program or file.</li>
                    <li><strong>GPU:</strong> The GPU helps make everything you see on the screen, from videos to video games, look clear and smooth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hard Drive (HDD) or SSD:</strong> These are where the PC stores all its files, games, and programs. SSDs are faster and make the PC run quicker.</li>
                    <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> This part gives power to all the other parts in the PC so they can work.</li>
                    <li><strong>BIOS/UEFI:</strong> This chip starts everything up when you turn on the PC and makes sure everything is working right.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cooling Fans:</strong> PCs can get really hot, so cooling fans help keep everything cool so the PC doesn’t overheat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expansion Slots:</strong> These are like extra spaces where you can add new parts to the PC, like a new graphics card or more memory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ports (HDMI, VGA, DisplayPort):</strong> These let you connect the PC to a monitor, TV, or projector so you can see what’s on the screen.</li>
                </ul>
